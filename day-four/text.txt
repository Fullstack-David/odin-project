A property is a "key:value" pair, where key is a string and value kan be anything



An empty object (“empty cabinet”) can be created using one of two syntaxes:
let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let user = {};  // "object literal" syntax

let user = {     // an object
  name: "John",  // by key "name" store value "John"
  age: 30        // by key "age" store value 30
};

-- In the user object, there are two properties:
The first property has the name "name" and the value "John".
The second one has the name "age" and the value 30.



-- Square brackets are much more powerful than dot notation. They allow any property names and variables. But they are also more cumbersome to write.
So most of the time, when property names are known and simple, the dot is used. And if we need something more complex, then we switch to square brackets.
